# Changelog
## [1.0.2] - 2022-09-23

Added the ability to add and remove folders to the backup, as well as switching to the new UI Toolkit. When backing up to a selected location, the system will now create a folder based on the project names name to hold all the zip backups.

## [1.0.1] - 2022-09-09

Fixed an issue with creating zip backups over 2GB, and removed the full compression down to normal compression so that people with slower computers weren't waiting an hour for their large projects to backup.


## [1.0.0] - 2022-09-09

This is the initial release of Studious Back Up package.
